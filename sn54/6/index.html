						<p>Near Sāvatthī. There the Blessed One said, “Monks, do you develop mindfulness of in-&amp;-out breathing?”</p>
						
						<p>When this was said, Ven. Ariṭṭha replied to the Blessed One, “I develop mindfulness of in-&amp;-out breathing, lord.”</p>
						
						<p>“But how do you develop mindfulness of in-&amp;-out breathing, Ariṭṭha?”</p>
						
						<p>“Having abandoned sensual desire for past sensual pleasures, lord, having done away with sensual desire for future sensual pleasures, and having thoroughly subdued perceptions of irritation with regard to internal &amp; external events, I breathe in mindfully and breathe out mindfully.”</p>
						
						<p>“There is that mindfulness of in-&amp;-out breathing, Ariṭṭha. I don’t say that there isn’t. But as to how mindfulness of in-&amp;-out breathing is brought in detail to its culmination, listen and pay close attention. I will speak.”</p>
						
						<p>“As you say, lord,” Ven. Ariṭṭha responded to the Blessed One.</p>
						
						<p>The Blessed One said, “And how, Ariṭṭha, is mindfulness of in-&amp;-out breathing brought in detail to its culmination? There is the case where a monk, having gone to the wilderness, to the shade of a tree, or to an empty building, sits down folding his legs crosswise, holding his body erect, and establishing mindfulness to the fore. Always mindful, he breathes in; mindful he breathes out.</p>
						
						<p>“[1] Breathing in long, he discerns, ‘I am breathing in long’; or breathing out long, he discerns, ‘I am breathing out long.’<br/>
						[2] Or breathing in short, he discerns, ‘I am breathing in short’; or breathing out short, he discerns, ‘I am breathing out short.’<br/>
						[3] He trains himself, ‘I will breathe in sensitive to the entire body.’ He trains himself, ‘I will breathe out sensitive to the entire body.’<br/>
						[4] He trains himself, ‘I will breathe in calming bodily fabrication.’ He trains himself, ‘I will breathe out calming bodily fabrication.’</p>
						
						<p>“[5] He trains himself, ‘I will breathe in sensitive to rapture.’ He trains himself, ‘I will breathe out sensitive to rapture.’<br/>
						[6] He trains himself, ‘I will breathe in sensitive to pleasure.’ He trains himself, ‘I will breathe out sensitive to pleasure.’<br/>
						[7] He trains himself, ‘I will breathe in sensitive to mental fabrication.’ He trains himself, ‘I will breathe out sensitive to mental fabrication.’<br/>
						[8] He trains himself, ‘I will breathe in calming mental fabrication.’ He trains himself, ‘I will breathe out calming mental fabrication.’</p>
						
						<p>“[9] He trains himself, ‘I will breathe in sensitive to the mind.’ He trains himself, ‘I will breathe out sensitive to the mind.’<br/>
						[10] He trains himself, ‘I will breathe in satisfying the mind.’ He trains himself, ‘I will breathe out satisfying the mind.’<br/>
						[11] He trains himself, ‘I will breathe in steadying the mind.’ He trains himself, ‘I will breathe out steadying the mind.<br/>
						[12] He trains himself, ‘I will breathe in releasing the mind.’ He trains himself, ‘I will breathe out releasing the mind.’</p>
						
						<p>“[13] He trains himself, ‘I will breathe in focusing on inconstancy.’ He trains himself, ‘I will breathe out focusing on inconstancy.’<br/>
						[14] He trains himself, ‘I will breathe in focusing on dispassion [lit: fading].’ He trains himself, ‘I will breathe out focusing on dispassion.’<br/>
						[15] He trains himself, ‘I will breathe in focusing on cessation.’ He trains himself, ‘I will breathe out focusing on cessation.’<br/>
						[16] He trains himself, ‘I will breathe in focusing on relinquishment.’ He trains himself, ‘I will breathe out focusing on relinquishment.’</p>
						
						<p>“This, Ariṭṭha, is how mindfulness of in-&amp;-out breathing is brought in detail to its culmination.”</p>
