					<p>“Monks, there are these five faculties. Which five? The faculty of conviction, the faculty of persistence, the faculty of mindfulness, the faculty of concentration, the faculty of discernment.</p>
					
					<p>“Now what is the faculty of conviction? There is the case where a monk, a disciple of the noble ones, has conviction, is convinced of the Tathāgata’s Awakening: ‘Indeed, the Blessed One is worthy and rightly self-awakened, consummate in knowledge &amp; conduct, well-gone, an expert with regard to the world, unexcelled as a trainer for those people fit to be tamed, the Teacher of divine &amp; human beings, awakened, blessed.’ This is called the faculty of conviction.</p>
					
					<p>“And what is the faculty of persistence? There is the case where a monk, a disciple of the noble ones, keeps his persistence aroused for abandoning unskillful mental qualities and taking on skillful mental qualities. He is steadfast, solid in his effort, not shirking his duties with regard to skillful mental qualities. </p>
					
					<p>He generates desire, endeavors, arouses persistence, upholds &amp; exerts his intent for the sake of the non-arising of evil, unskillful qualities that have not yet arisen. </p>
					
					<p>He generates desire, endeavors, arouses persistence, upholds &amp; exerts his intent for the sake of the abandoning of evil, unskillful qualities that have arisen.</p>
					
					<p>He generates desire, endeavors, arouses persistence, upholds &amp; exerts his intent for the sake of the arising of skillful qualities that have not yet arisen.</p>
					
					<p>He generates desire, endeavors, arouses persistence, upholds &amp; exerts his intent for the maintenance, non-confusion, increase, plenitude, development, &amp; culmination of skillful qualities that have arisen.</p>
					
					<p>This is called the faculty of persistence.</p>
					
					<p>“And what is the faculty of mindfulness? There is the case where a monk, a disciple of the noble ones, is mindful, highly meticulous, remembering &amp; able to call to mind even things that were done &amp; said long ago. </p>
					
					<p>He remains focused on the body in &amp; of itself — ardent, alert, &amp; mindful — putting aside greed &amp; distress with reference to the world. </p>
					
					<p>He remains focused on feelings in &amp; of themselves — ardent, alert, &amp; mindful — putting aside greed &amp; distress with reference to the world.</p>
					
					<p>He remains focused on the mind in &amp; of itself — ardent, alert, &amp; mindful — putting aside greed &amp; distress with reference to the world.</p>
					
					<p>He remains focused on mental qualities in &amp; of themselves — ardent, alert, &amp; mindful — putting aside greed &amp; distress with reference to the world. </p>
					
					<p>This is called the faculty of mindfulness.</p>
					
					<p>“And what is the faculty of concentration? </p>
					
					<p>There is the case where a monk, a disciple of the noble ones, making it his object to let go, attains concentration, attains singleness of mind. Quite withdrawn from sensuality, withdrawn from unskillful mental qualities, he enters &amp; remains in the first jhāna: rapture &amp; pleasure born from withdrawal, accompanied by directed thought &amp; evaluation.</p>
					
					<p>With the stilling of directed thoughts &amp; evaluations, he enters &amp; remains in the second jhāna: rapture &amp; pleasure born of composure, unification of awareness free from directed thought &amp; evaluation — internal assurance. </p>
					
					<p>With the fading of rapture, he remains equanimous, mindful, &amp; alert, and senses pleasure with the body. He enters &amp; remains in the third jhāna, of which the Noble Ones declare, ‘Equanimous &amp; mindful, he has a pleasant abiding.’ </p>
					
					<p>With the abandoning of pleasure &amp; pain — as with the earlier disappearance of elation &amp; distress — he enters &amp; remains in the fourth jhāna: purity of equanimity &amp; mindfulness, neither pleasure nor pain. </p>
					
					<p>This is called the faculty of concentration.</p>
					
					<p>“And what is the faculty of discernment? </p>
					
					<p>There is the case where a monk, a disciple of the noble ones, is discerning, endowed with discernment of arising &amp; passing away — noble, penetrating, leading to the right ending of stress. </p>
					
					<p>He discerns, as it has come to be: ‘This is stress... This is the origination of stress... This is the cessation of stress... This is the path of practice leading to the cessation of stress.’ </p>
					
					<p>This is called the faculty of discernment.</p>
					
					<p>“These are the five faculties.”</p>
